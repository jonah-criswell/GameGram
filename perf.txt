perf.txt file that lists the statements you used to create indexes:

CREATE INDEX idx_game_name ON games (name);

This file should also include the queries that were affected by the indexes.

                    SELECT g.game_id, g.name, g.genre, p.platform, p.year, p.publisher, p.na_sales, p.eu_sales, p.jp_sales, p.other_sales, p.global_sales
                    FROM games g
                    JOIN platforms p ON p.game_id = g.game_id
                    WHERE g.name LIKE ?
                """

Under each query provide time consumption before and after adding the index. This should be done after populating the database with data.
