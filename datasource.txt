A description of how you generated data if you created/used a program to generate data.

We retrieved a CSV of video game sales from kaggle. Each row contains a video game, its platform, publisher, sales in multiple regions, and a rank based on its number  of  sales. 
Out of this we created SQL insert statements to produce 2 tables since the original data split the same game up if it was re-released under different publishers on different platforms. 
These tables are the games table, which contains individual games without duplication, and the platforms table, which contains the information that differs with different releases of the same game.
