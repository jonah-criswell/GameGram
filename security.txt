# security.txt - User Password Security

[Passwords]
All user passwords are never stored in plain text. We use the bcrypt hashing algorithm
to securely hash passwords before storing them in our database. Bcrypt automatically
generates a unique salt for each password and performs multiple rounds of hashing,
making it computationally expensive for attackers to reverse.

[Approach]
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with a work factor (cost) of 12.
- Unique salts are generated for each password automatically by bcrypt.
- Only the resulting hash is stored; the plain password is never persisted.
- During login, the input password is hashed and compared to the stored hash.
- No reversible encryption is used; even database access does not reveal passwords.
